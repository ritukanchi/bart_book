# Text Summarization with BART and PyMuPDF

This Python script implementation using BART, a sequence-to-sequence model for text summarization, along with PyMuPDF for handling PDFs. It extracts text from a PDF, generates a summary using BART, and saves the summary as a new PDF.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip3 install PyMuPDF transformers 
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone 
```

2. Run the script with your PDF file:
```bash
python text_summarization.py
```

This example summarizes the content of the text+summarization.pdf file.

## Further details
This is part of a larger project that I am working on, involving the build of a book recommendation system.
